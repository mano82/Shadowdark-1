Spellcasters use the raw power of creation and destruction to bend reality, shaping it to the will of their gods or ambitions.

**Wizard** magic is fickle, complicated, and volatile. Even the most learned mages tread carefully when reaching beyond the veil to grasp arcane energies.

**Priest** magic is miraculous, sacred, and instinctive. Priests who offend their gods might lose the ability to cast spells until they can undertake penance.

## Spellcasting
When you cast a spell, you invoke magic to cause an effect. Casting a spell takes your action.

Characters with the spellcasting talent can cast spells.

To cast a wizard spell you know, make a spellcasting check by rolling 1d20 + your Intelligence modifier.

To cast a priest spell you know, make a spellcasting check by rolling 1d20 + your Wisdom modifier.

The DC to successfully cast a spell is 10 + the spell’s tier.

## Results
If you **succeed** on your spellcasting check, the spell takes effect.

If you fail your spellcasting check, the spell does not take effect. You can’t cast that spell again until you complete a rest.

## Critical Success
If you roll a natural 20 on your spellcasting check, you may double one of the spell’s numerical effects. This remains in effect on a **focus** spell (see pg. 50) until your next focus check.

## Critical Failure
If you roll a natural 1 on your spellcasting check, the spell does not take effect. If it was a **focus** spell, the spell immediately ends (see pg. 50 for more details on focus spells).

**Wizard Spell.** If the spell was a wizard spell, you can’t cast that spell again until you successfully complete a rest. You must also roll on the [[Wizard Mishaps]] table corresponding to the spell’s tier (see pg. 46).

**Priest Spell.** If the spell was a priest spell, your deity is greatly displeased and revokes its power. You can’t cast that spell again until you complete ritualistic penance to your deity and successfully complete a rest.

## Penance
The GM determines the exact nature of the penance you must undertake based on your deity and alignment.

Penance requires a holy quest, ritualistic atonement, or a material sacrifice that you donate or destroy.

Inadequate or subversive penance (such as donating your sacrifice to a party member) only displeases your deity further and makes the spell loss permanent.
