## **Tiers**
Spells are classified according to their tiers, which range from 1-5.

## **Range**
Range determines at what distance (close, near, or far) you can deliver the spell’s effects. Self range means you can only target yourself with the spell.

## **Duration**
Duration is how long the spell effects last. Spells can have an instant effect or last for several turns, rounds, or longer. See [[Spell Attributes#FOCUS]] for spells with a focus duration.

## **Overlapping Effects**
Ongoing effects of the same spell on the same target do not combine. The spell with the most powerful effect takes precedence, such as the spell with the longer remaining duration.

## **Focus**
Some spells last for as long as you focus. You can’t cast other focus spells while focusing. You can end a focus spell at any time.

To maintain focus, make a spellcasting check at the start of your turn as if you were casting that spell.

### Success.
The spell remains in effect until the start of your next turn.

### Failure.
The spell ends. If you were focusing, you do not lose the ability to cast that spell. However, if you critically fail on a check to maintain focus, treat it as a standard critical failure (see pg. 45 for details on criticals).

If you take damage or become distracted while focusing (due to an earthquake, for example), you must immediately make a spellcasting check to maintain focus.
