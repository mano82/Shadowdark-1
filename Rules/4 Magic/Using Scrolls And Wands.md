Scrolls and wands contain magic spells. Spellcasters can use them to cast these spells if the spell is on their spell list (even if they don't know the spell).

To do so, they must succeed on a spellcasting check with a DC of **10 + the tier** of the spell contained in the wand or scroll.

**Failing** to cast a spell from a wand or scroll does not impact the ability to cast known spells.

## **Scrolls**
After a spellcasting attempt with a scroll, the magical writing disappears from the scroll and it ceases to work. On a critical failure, casters with mishap tables must roll a mishap.

## **Wands**
On a failed casting attempt, the wand stops working until you complete a rest. On a critical failure , the wand permanently breaks, and casters with mishap tables must roll a mishap.
