## The Game Master
The Game Master is the world-spinner, the all-wise, the ventriloquist.

You are the deadly pit trap and the assassin in the night. You are the storm. The army. The gods.

You hold ultimate power.

Yet you only want one thing: to see your players triumph.

So you craft malevolent villains worth defeating. You sculpt marvelous treasures worth stealing. You fill the world with rot, darkness, and death so it can be driven back by sword, spell, and flame.

Through this, you offer an invitation. You propose it loudly with roaring dragons, humbly with helpless villagers, secretly with hidden treasure maps.

You call the players to adventure.

And they answer.

## The Only Rule
The Only Rule is that you make the rules.

What's written in this book is a guide, not a constraint, and none of it takes precedence over your judgment.

If something doesn't work at your table, change it or throw it out and don't look back.

## The Pact
You and your players are gaming together to have fun, prop each other up, and strengthen bonds. This is The Pact.

The Pact is often unspoken and unseen, but it is always felt.

It is based on goodwill, respect, and fellowship.

Its enemies are selfishness, antagonism, and arrogance.

Decisions made to defend The Pact are always good ones.
