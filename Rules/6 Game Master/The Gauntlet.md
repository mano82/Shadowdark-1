## The Gauntlet
Game Masters can use a process called The Gauntlet to determine the players' starting characters.

The Gauntlet works best when the players use the random generation process (see pg. 40) to create four 0-level characters each.

Random generation prevents "build tuning" and over-investingin any single character, because
The Gauntlet is...

## Deadly!
The Gauntlet is much deadlier than a typical adventure. Most characters won't survive it. 0-level PCs who fall to 0 HP die instantly.

Each player will end up with one peasant who makes it through the ordeal. Each player's active surviving character graduates to 1st level, gains a class, and becomes their character for future adventures.

## How To Run It
The Gauntlet usually takes place in a well-established dungeon stocked with brutal traps, large groups of monsters, and evil plots drawing close to fruition.

The monsters and traps aren't undefeatable, but many are likely to cause casualties.

The Gauntlet can sometimes be comedic in its savagery, but not everything should be a death trap. Include enticing rewards that encourage risk-taking.

Players each choose one of their 0-level characters to play at a time. Players replace dead characters from their backup pool and invent a fitting explanation. Reinforcements from town or a rescued prisoner!

## Total Loss
If a player loses every 0-level character during The Gauntlet, that player can create 1d4 more 0-level characters to pull from.
