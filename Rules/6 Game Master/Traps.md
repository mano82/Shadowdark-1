Traps add peril and surprise to crawling. Characters typically get to make a relevant stat check to avoid a trap's effects.

### A Tell.
Most traps should have a hint or tell. Be careful not to make traps too frequent or the game pace will suffer.

### Finding.
Characters who search a specific area or object for a trap automatically find it.

### Disabling.
Thieves and characters who are trained in tinkering can describe how they disable or circumvent a trap.

If the character has enough time and uses a reasonable method, the character succeeds.

If there is time pressure or the trap requires a great deal of skill to deactivate, the GM might call for a stat check.
