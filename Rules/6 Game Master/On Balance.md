## Be Unpredictable
In this book, more than a few words are spent explaining the "typical" amount of treasure [[Awarding XP]] (pg. 117) or the "average" build of a [[Designing Monsters]] (pg. 192).

But typical and average adventuring is not the goal.

These numbers are calibrations so you know where to start. Use them to feel out the rudder of your game and know what makes something easy or hard.

Then, become unpredictable.

If the players think they can win every fight, they won't feel fear. They won't be careful. They won't use their wits.

If all treasure is similar in value, there will be no epic trophies to pursue. No motivation.

Instead, fill your world with stark dangers and stunning treasures. The most glorious victories are the hard-earned ones.

## Telegraph Danger
When you remove predictability, you'll want to add a replacement ingredient: telegraphing danger.

Don't make threats a secret (unless the players utterly failed to gather information).

If the characters are getting close to a manticore's cave, describe the crushed skulls and bones, the reek of rotting meat, and the silence of the birds.

## Choices Matter
A choice between two identical options ("Which door do you open, the one on the left or the right?") is not actually a choice.

Players need a way to gather information about their options and make an informed decision. That creates interesting choices.

Careful players should be able to find the deep claw marks on one of the doors or catch the low snoring on the other side.
