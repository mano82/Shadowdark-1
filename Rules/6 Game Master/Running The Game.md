## Adventures
An adventure is a set of related encounters and incidents that tie to a common plot thread. For example, the characters might go on an adventure to defeat the ruinous plague-cultists hiding beneath the Temple of Krull.

Devising an adventure requires the characters to have a problem or desire they can solve using their unique skills. These are usually tied to a person, location, or item. Often, there is time pressure driving the characters to act.

See the Adventures section on pg. 122 for adventure ideas.

## Campaigns
Adventures that tie together into a series of related stories are a campaign. Sometimes, campaigns are centered around a plot or villain, and sometimes they grow out of the characters' explorations and deeds.


## NPCs
Non-player characters (NPCs) are rich sources of quests, treasure, danger, and motivation.

Not all NPCs need a backstory, but giving each a name, appearance, mannerism, and secret makes them into memorable personas.

See NPCs on pg. 124 and Rival Crawlers on pg. 126 for ideas and generation tables.

## The Mundane
The characters transform from weak peasants into legendary heroes by adventuring. During that journey, the importance of basic gear, the fleeting nature of wealth, and the danger of a pack of armed bandits should never become mere trifles.

Even a 10th-level character's life should sometimes depend on whether a simple, mundane rope snaps or holds.

## Setting DCs
The four standard DCs of **easy** (9), **normal** (12), **hard** (15), and **extreme** (18) are universal and help you quickly decide a DC.

When determining the difficulty of a task, take the creature into account. Finding a trail in a sunny field would be an easy task for a forest elf with tracking skills, but it would be a hard task for a sun-dazzled cave troll.

When you ask players to make a check, state what kind of check it is. For example, an _easy Charisma check_ or a _DC 15 Dexterity check_. That way, the players know what they need to roll to succeed.

## Challenge Variety
The characters should face a multitude of challenges during an adventure, including combat, dealing with NPCs, or overcoming the environment.

Each class excels at different tasks. Thieves love to scout and talk to NPCs, fighters and priests shine in combat, and wizards dominate the environment.

## Character Skill Vs. Player Skill
Characters aren't the only ones who level up. Players also gain experience!

For example, players will learn where to look for secret doors and what the "tells" are. As they go on more adventures, they become better at gameplay.

Encourage this by giving players the opportunity to make decisions that rely on their creativity and wits, not on their dice rolls or stat bonuses.

## Rules Vs. Rulings
If there were a rule for every situation, we would be living inside the rulebook instead of the game world.

As the GM, you have infinite power with only a handful of rules. Stat checks and the standard DCs can resolve any action. You need nothing more.

Rather than pore through the book, adjudicate using what you already know. Make a ruling, roll the dice, and keep going!
