## Settlement Maps

Roll or choose a settlement type. Then, take the number of dice listed and roll them together on a blank sheet of standard paper.

Draw a broad outline around where the dice fell to determine the settlement's shape.

Then, note the position and number on each die to determine what district is in that location. Separate the districts by rough lines and shapes to create main streets.

The settlement's seat of government is located in the district with the highest roll.

Each district has 1d4 main **points of interest**.

Roll an alignment for the overall settlement or for each district. Treat chaotic settlements and districts as risky when checking for random encounters.

Roll taverns on pg. 136 and shops on pg. 138.
