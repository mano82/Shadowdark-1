## The World
What is your game world like? Decide on a few major elements to start. You'll want to consider the following:

- What's the **environment** like? Jungle, desert, swamps, cityscape, oceanic, tundra?
- How does the world handle **magic**? Are wizards abundant, or in hiding? Can priests use healing spells?
- What's the overall **theme**? Grimdark, mythical, urban, gonzo, horror?

## The Characters
Are there any character creation rules in your game world? For example, some GMs only allow lawful or neutral characters.

Allow the players' ideas to shape reality. Is the priest from an order of witch-hunting zealots? Is the fighter a Red Siege veteran? Add those backstory elements to the game world!

## Session Zero
Help the players make their characters ahead of the first session.

This is an opportunity for the players to establish how their characters know each other, build out backstories, and roleplay precursory scenes.

## Start Small
You don't have to develop much for your first game. You need a starting location, a few interesting NPCs, and a short adventure site.

Since the characters already know each other from session zero, kick off the first game in the middle of a dangerous incident or dramatic situation. Bring on the action!

Problems and rumors lead to adventures. If you keep introducing both to the characters, your world will continue to sprout and grow.
