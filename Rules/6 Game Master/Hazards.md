## Hazards
Hazards add passive danger to the adventuring environment. There is often no way to defeat or permanently disable them.

Unlike traps, most hazards are obvious from the start.

### Movement Restriction.
Some hazards inhibit or prevent movement, such as quicksand pools or slippery ice. Hazards can even fully entrap characters.

### Damage.
Some hazards deal ongoing damage, such as toxic spores or acid rain.

### Weakening.
Certain hazards weaken or hamper the characters. These could include antimagic zones or vapors that sap physical strength.

### Combining.
The most insidious hazards combine one or more of these types into a single threat.
