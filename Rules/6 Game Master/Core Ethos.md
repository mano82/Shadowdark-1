These are **Shadowdark RPG's** core principles and foundations.

## Time
The most important resource. It must haunt the characters' every decision. They don't have time to search every floor tile for a trap.

## Darkness
Respect the darkness. It is the true foe. Few things can hold it at bay, and nothing must make those prized tools obsolete.

## Gear
Gear is precious and limited. Give value and utility to all of it.

## Action Economy
PCs get just one action per turn. Make it count. Use multitasking (pg. 88) for boring small stuff.

## Information
Dispense information freely. If the characters test the floor where there's a trap, they find it.

## Distance
Close, near, and far distances are loose and don't require precise measurement. Nobody wants to miss firing an arrow into a dragon's eye because of a mere 5-foot deficit.

## Danger
Casting spells comes with great risk. Magic items are volatile. Fights are fast and unfair. Monsters are insidious.

## Rewarding Investment
Honor what has been earned. If a character learns a new language, make it matter. Allow new titles or iconic deeds to have an impact on the characters' lives.

## Stat Checks
The characters automatically succeed at what they are trained to do. Only use stat checks when there is time pressure and failure has dire consequences.
