## Purpose
Random encounters are a way to keep time pressure up. If the characters linger too long, they'll run the risk of more encounters.

## How Often?
The GM checks for random encounters during crawling rounds (not combat) based on the environment's danger level.
- **Unsafe.** Check every 3 rounds.
- **Risky.** Check every 2 rounds.
- **Deadly.** Check every round.
- 
To check for a random encounter, the GM rolls 1d6. An encounter occurs on a result of 1.

The GM might also check for an encounter if the characters create a loud disturbance.

For **overland travel** , check for random encounters based on hours in place of rounds (see pg. 90 for overland travel details).

## Starting Distance
If one or more wandering creatures appear, roll 1d6 for their distance from the group.
##### Distance
| `dice: d6` | **Starting Distance** |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| 1          | Close                 |
| 2-4        | Near                  |
| 5-6        | Far                   |

## What Is It Doing?
When the characters encounter new creatures, roll to determine the creatures' current activity. This might impact how likely they are to notice the characters.

##### Activity
| `dice: 2d6` | **Activity**        |
|:-----------:| ------------------- |
|     2-4     | Hunting             |
|     5-6     | Eating              |
|     7-8     | Building/nesting    |
|    9-10     | Socializing/playing |
|     11      | Guarding            |
|     12      | Sleeping            |
^Activity

## Reaction Check
When the characters encounter random creatures, the GM rolls for the creatures' attitude (if it would not already be clear).

If the characters immediately interact with the creatures to influence their attitude, one of the interacting characters may **add their Charisma modifier** to the reaction check.

The interacting characters reveal their presence and position to the creatures.

Some vicious creatures, such as undead, are always hostile.

##### Reaction
| `dice: 2d6`+ CHA mod | **Attitude** |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| 0-6                  | Hostile      |
| 7-8                  | Suspicious   |
| 9                    | Neutral      |
| 10-11                | Curious      |
| 12+                  | Friendly     |

## Treasure
There's a 50% chance a randomly encountered creature (or group of creatures) has no treasure.
