## Attack The Light
A main source of time pressure in Shadowdark RPG is the limited duration of light sources.

Don't let light sources be "set it and forget it." The characters must protect their light sources and keep them from going out.

Here are some ideas for how to attack the light source:

- Imperil torches and lanterns on **random encounter tables.**
- Have **enemies** try to extinguish light sources.
- Have opposing **spellcasters** hit the target of _light_ spells with _dispel magic_ or other magic-neutralizing effects.
- Have the **environment** put the light source at risk; gusts of wind, dead-magic zones, thin air, dripping cave ceilings, explosive gas, falling debris.
- Remember that **dropping** a torch or lantern might extinguish or break it.
