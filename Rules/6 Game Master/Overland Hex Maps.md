To begin an overland hex map, roll or choose a starting terrain type from the Hex Terrain table.

Each time the characters move into an empty hex, roll on the New Hex table.

Treat steps on the Hex Terrain table as a **circular loop.** Jump back to the beginning if you roll a New Hex result that would count you off the chart.

For each hex, roll a d6. On a 1, the hex has one **point of interest.** If you roll a cataclysm, use the below table.
