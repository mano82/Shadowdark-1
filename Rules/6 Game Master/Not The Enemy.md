## Neutral Arbiter
You're not the players' enemy; you're portraying the world as it is. Roll your dice out in the open and let the players create their own trouble.

**_Shadowdark RPG_** has the following mechanics that tempt the players into taking risks.

### Random encounters.
Characters push their luck the longer they linger in dangerous areas. Not all wandering monsters are hostile (see Reaction Check, pg. 113), but there's no guarantee.

### Light timers.
If the characters run out of light, they have a poor chance of surviving a monster attack or deadly trap.

### Resource management.
Gear slots are precious. Is it more important to make room for treasure or bring extra torches?

### XP.
The temptation of treasure and XP pulls many characters deeper into the dungeon.

## Character Death
Character deaths will happen (especially among 0-level adventurers)! The dice can be fickle, and crawlers sometimes get into more trouble than they can handle down in the Shadowdark.

When a character dies due to the player's choices and it makes sense, it was a just death.

If there is uncertainty ("Did you remember to add your Constitution modifier to your death timer?"), clarify, and then let fate fall.

A game world without death is one without risk or tension.
