## Adventure Hooks
When you give adventure hooks to the characters, you're actually encouraging the *players* to grab onto those threads.

While you can't expect your players to take every hook, you can make a call to adventure more enticing by knowing what your players want.

Player motivations generally fall into the following categories. Powerful adventure hooks contain elements of all three.

### Reward.
Players want more treasure and XP to make their characters stronger.

### Heroism. 
Players want to right wrongs, save the day, or make a name for their characters. This is especially true for players who love role-playing.

### Discovery. 
Much like solving a mystery, players want to know why a problem or location exists and what secrets it hides.

## The Audience
The players are the real audience to the game's story, not the characters. Lean into this!

For example, the players might be in great suspense because you just rolled a random encounter check in front of them. Similar to a horror movie where the audience watches a murderer slink toward the main character, the suspense comes from the players not knowing what is about to happen.

## Dramatic Question
Most encounters have a simple yes/no question driving the interest. When that question is answered, the encounter is no longer exciting to the players, and it's time to move forward.

Dramatic questions are not always obvious. The question for an encounter with a troll guarding a bridge is not whether the characters can kill the troll, but whether they can get across!
