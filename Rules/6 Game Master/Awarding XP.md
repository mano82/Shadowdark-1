Characters gain XP from the valuable treasures and boons they earn during an adventure.

XP awards don't need to reflect monetary value; boons or fabled items have intangible worth.

Treasure has four categories:

- **Poor** (0 XP): Mundane, low
    value, ordinary, unexciting.
- **Normal** (1 XP): Good value,
    worth protecting, useful.
- **Fabulous** (3 XP): Incredible,
    prized, well-guarded.
- **Legendary** (10 XP): Mythic,
    unique, quest-worthy.

Each PC gets the full XP value of each treasure. When PCs gain a new level, their XP resets to zero.

## Sources Of XP

- Gold and gems
- Oaths, secrets, and blessings
- Magic items
- Meaningful trophies/tokens
- Clever thinking (award 1 XP for ingenious actions)


## How Much Gold?
Over time, PCs will earn and lose gold through adventuring, carousing, and buying gear.

Per treasure find , each group should gain about 10 gp x their average party level in value, or:

- 20 gp in value, levels 0-3
- 50 gp in value, levels 4-6
- 80 gp in value, levels 7-9
