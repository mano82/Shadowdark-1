## Armor Class
Just like characters, monsters have an AC that denotes how difficult it is to harm them.

## Hit Points
Calculate a monster's hit points ( HP ) by rolling a number of d8s per monster level ( LV ) and adding its CON modifier (minimum 1). You can also use the average total listed.

## Attacks
Most monsters can make one or two attacks per turn ( ATK ), but some can make more. Attack bonuses and damage are listed for each.

## Movement
Monsters can typically move ( MV ) near each turn, but some can move other distances. If a monster has a special mode of movement, such as flying or swimming, it is noted after the distance.

## Stat Modifiers
Monsters have modifiers listed for Strength ( S ), Dexterity ( D ), Constitution ( C ), Intelligence ( I ), Wisdom ( W ), and Charisma ( Ch ).

## Alignment
All monsters have a typical alignment ( AL ) for their species.
Individual monsters might have a different alignment.

## Spellcasting
Treat monster spellcasting the same as character spellcasting. For a natural 1 on an INT or CHA spell, roll on the Wizard Mishap tables (pg. 46). A natural 1 on a WIS spell incurs penance. The tier is the spellcasting DC - 10.

## Dark-Adapted
All non-humanoid monsters are dark-adapted. Their powerful senses allow them to ignore the penalties of total darkness (see pg. 84). Blinding or deafening a monster still hinders it.
