Adventurers fear the unknown. Keep monsters unfamiliar by  adding mutations to them.

Mutations can inspire new  abilities or attacks. For example, you might decide a spider with  wings can fly a near distance.

As another example, you might determine that a monster with tentacles can restrain creatures.

Roll up to three mutations per monster. Treat a mutated monster as two levels higher than normal for rolling treasure.
