Between adventures, you can choose to undertake one downtime activity.

## Carousing
Carousing is a way for you to convert the coin you've earned into XP and other benefits.

You'll likely come out of a carousing event with a new NPC contact, whether friend or foe. You might even acquire a new magic item if you're bold and lucky enough.

Carousing can last for several days of in-game time, so the GM will use the [[Time#Time Passes]] rule (pg. 82) as needed.

If you want to play out a gambling scene in detail, you can use the [[Wizards & Thieves - Dice Game]] on pg. 94 to determine who wins a bet and how many valuables change hands.

See [[Carousing]] pg. 92 for more details on carousing.

## Learning
Your character may wish to learn a new skill during downtime.

In order to learn a new skill, you must find a capable instructor who is willing to teach you.

You can't typically learn another class's or ancestry's unique talents, but you can learn auxiliary skills. Examples include a new language, or how to ride a sandworm using a harness.

Learning enables you to do new actions or gives you advantage on certain checks.

Work with the GM to determine what you can try to learn. Then, make an extreme (DC 18) Intelligence check. If you succeed , you learn the new skill.

If you fail , you can try again as your next downtime activity, this time lowering the difficulty of the Intelligence check by one step.
