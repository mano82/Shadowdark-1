## The Shadowdark
The Shadowdark is any place where darkness, danger, and myth reign supreme.

It could be in crumbling ruins, ancient mountain strongholds, or mysterious towers. It could be in gloomy forests, trap-laden pyramids, or haunted sea caves.

As long as the characters are going into danger with swords, spells, and torches ready, they're going into the Shadowdark.

## Crawling Rounds
Characters are in **crawling rounds** while not in combat. They are exploring, talking, and engaging with the environment.

## Vision
All characters need light to see, but that's not true for the darkness-adapted beings of the Shadowdark. Note that any area outside of a light source's illumination is in total darkness.

## Light Sources
Most light sources last for up to an hour of real time and illuminate a limited area.

Players have two options when lighting more than one light source at a time:
1. The newer light source "rides along" on the current timer.
2. Extinguish all old light sources & Start a new timer with the fresh light source.

The GM can make rulings counter to the above; the purpose is to make tracking light timers simple, not frustrating.

## Total Darkness
While in total darkness, a creature who is not darkness-adapted has disadvantage on tasks it undertakes that require sight. Also, the environment becomes deadly. The GM checks for a random encounter every crawling round.

## Movement
### Distances.
Distances are broken up into:
- **close** (5 feet)
- **near** (up to 30 feet)
- **far** (within sight during an encounter or scene).

### Climbing.
Strength or Dexterity check to climb half your speed. Fall if you fail by 5+ points.

### Falling.
You take 1d6 damage for every 10 feet you fall.

### Moving Through.
You can move freely through allies. You must pass a Strength or Dexterity check to move through enemies.

### Swimming.
Swim half speed (requires a STR check in rough water). Make a CON check each round you hold your breath. On a failed CON check, 1d6 damage a round until you exit the hazard.

## Regroup
During crawling rounds, the GM can allow the players to **regroup**. PCs within reasonable reach of each other can come together into a marching order. They can also move as a group, taking a round each time. When needed, initiative shifts back to turns.


## Conditions
Some effects impose a condition on a character, such as blindness or immobility. Advantage and disadvantage apply to most situations. Use common sense.

For example, a blinded character has disadvantage on tasks requiring sight, and a PC stuck in a spider web can't move.


## Actions
While crawling, characters can take actions that might include:
- Prying a gem from a statue
- Sneaking up on a slumbering manticore
- Tapping on a suspicious wall to check for a hidden door
- Scanning a room for signs of hidden enemies
- Giving a rousing speech to a group of fearful townsfolk


## Encounters
An encounter occurs when any challenge presents itself that stops the characters' progress. See pg. 112 for information on random encounters.
