When a fight breaks out, **combat rounds** begin!

## Determine Surprise
The GM determines if any creatures are unaware of each other. A creature who surprises another takes one turn before a new initiative order is rolled.

## Combat Initative!
After surprise turns, the GM calls for new initiative. Everyone makes a Dexterity check (the GM uses the highest Dexterity modifier of any monsters).

The person with the highest result takes the first turn. Turns go clockwise from that person.

## Combat Turns
Characters can take one action and move near on their turn, splitting up the movement however they want. Characters can move near again if they don't take an action.

## Actions
### Melee Attack. 
Melee attacks use melee weapons. Roll 1d20 + your Strength modifier + talent bonuses. You hit the target if your total is equal to or greater than its AC.

### Ranged Attack. 
Ranged attacks use ranged weapons. Roll 1d20 + your Dexterity modifier + talent bonuses. You hit the target if your total is equal to or greater than its AC.

### Cast A Spell. 
Casting a spell takes one action (see [[Casting Spells]] on pg. 44).

### Improvise. 
Do an improvised action, such as swinging across a ravine on a vine. The GM might determine it requires a stat check or attack roll.

### Multitask. 
Characters can do small, parallel tasks on their turns, such as standing up, speaking, activating a magic item, or quaffing a potion. This doesn't typically use their action.

## Damage
When you hit a target with an attack or spell, you damage it. Roll your weapon or spell's damage dice + relevant bonuses. The GM subtracts that amount from the target's hit points.

### Knockout.
You can choose to knock a creature unconscious instead of killing it if you reduce it to 0 hit points.

### Critical Hit.
You deal a critical hit if you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll or spellcasting check. For a **weapon** , double its damage dice on the attack. For a **spell** , you may double one of its numerical effects (see pg. 45).

## Terrain
Attacking or casting a spell on a creature that is hiding at least half its body behind interposing terrain has disadvantage.

If you can't see a creature at all due to terrain, you can't target it.

Creatures can only move half the normal distance through terrain that hampers free movement, such as ice or deep mud.

## Morale
Enemies who are reduced to half their number (or half their HP for a solo enemy) flee if they fail a DC 15 Wisdom check. For large groups, the GM makes one check with the leader's modifier.

## Death
A character who goes to 0 HP falls unconscious and is dying. A character who goes above 0 HP wakes up and is no longer dying.

### Death Timer.
A dying character rolls 1d4 + their CON modifier (minimum 1 total) on their turn. They die in that many rounds unless healed or stabilized.

On each of the character's subsequent turns, that player rolls a d20. On a natural 20, the character rises with 1 hit point.

### Stabilize.
An intelligent being can give first aid to a dying creature at close range. On a successful DC 15 Intelligence check, the target stops dying (but is still unconscious).

### Death.
A character who perishes is retired from the game.
