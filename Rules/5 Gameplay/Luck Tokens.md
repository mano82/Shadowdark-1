Sometimes the GM awards a **luck token** to a player for exceptional roleplaying, heroism, or just plain coolness.

Big sacrifices, moving speeches, or incredibly daring manoeuvres might be worthy of luck tokens, whether or not the characters' actions were successful.

Each player can only have one luck token at a time.

You can cash in a luck token to reroll any roll you just made. You must use the new result.

You can also give your luck token to a companion.

## How Many To Give?

The GM might award 2-3 new luck tokens per player during the course of a session with a pulpy, heroic feel.

Alternatively, the GM might not give out any new luck tokens during a game session that is grim, difficult, and dark.
