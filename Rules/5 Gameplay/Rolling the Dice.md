## Advantage
When you have advantage on a roll, it means you're in a strong position to succeed.

For example, you might be attacking from the high ground, or you might have just failed at a task and now have insight into how to succeed if you try again.

To roll with advantage, roll the same die twice and use the better result.

## Disadvantage
When you have disadvantage on a roll, it means you're in a strong position to fail.

For example, you might be trying to strike an enemy while blinded by sand, or navigating a maze while confused by disorienting poison.

To roll with disadvantage, roll the same die twice and use the worse result.

## Canceling
If you have both advantage and disadvantage on a roll, they cancel each other out.

## Natural 20
When a d20 die roll shows a 20, what you're doing succeeds to your maximum capacity. An attack roll automatically hits and is a critical hit (see Damage on pg. 89).

## Natural 1
When a d20 die roll shows a 1, what you're doing fails to your maximum capacity. An attack roll automatically misses and might even strike an ally.

## The d6 Decider
If there's a random chance for an outcome, such as whether a dropped torch goes out, the GM calls for a d6 roll. A 1-3 results in the worse outcome for the players, and a 4-6 results in the better one.
