## Initiative
**Shadowdark RPG** is played in turn order right from the start.

At the beginning of the game, the GM establishes **initiative** , or the order in which the players act. Everyone rolls a d20 and adds their DEX modifier. The GM adds the highest DEX modifier of any monsters, if relevant.

The person who rolled the highest takes the first turn, and the turn order moves clockwise from that individual.

## Freeform Mode
Initiative need not be strict; some GMs keep only a loose round-robin, allowing the players to decide their turn order and actions before circling back to the GM's turn.

Players might declare their actions as a group or act simultaneously, and the GM will need to adjudicate. A round passes once everyone has acted.

## Player Turn
1. The player counts down any personal timers for spells and other effects.
2. The player takes an action and may move up to near (split up in any way). The player can move near again if skipping an action.
3. The GM describes what happens as a result of the player's turn.

## GM Turn
1. The GM counts down any timers not tracked by players.
2. The GM checks for a random encounter, if needed.
3. The GM takes actions and makes movements for any relevant creatures or environmental effects.
4. The GM describes what the characters notice as a result of steps 1-3.
