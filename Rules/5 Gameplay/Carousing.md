When you return from the Shadowdark, you can carouse to celebrate your heroic exploits.

To carouse, each participant pitches in for the cost of the event. Then, each participant rolls 1d8 + the event's bonus to determine their own outcome.

## Outcomes
Each character gains the XP noted for their result along with any other ill or positive effects.

If the group decides to play out the results of an individual roll, the entire carousing group is usually present for the events.
