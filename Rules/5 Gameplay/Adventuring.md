## Crawlers
Those who dare the lost halls and caverns of the Shadowdark are called by many names. Crawlers, delvers, explorers, adventurers, treasure hunters.

In this chapter, you'll learn how to crawl with the best of them. Whether you're exploring a lightless barrow mound or the Shrouded Forest of Eld, the rules herein will guide you.

## Outside The Sheet
The first step to crawling is understanding your environment and imagining an action you want to take.

Don't simply scour your character sheet for ideas and options! Your crawling career depends on your ability to "think outside the sheet."

Imagine what you would really do if you were in your character's situation.

Do you see a suit of armor in an alcove? Maybe you lift the helm's visor and make sure nothing is looking back at you.

Do you hear faint voices behind a rotting, wooden door? Maybe you creep up and press your ear against it to hear what's happening on the other side.

Is a band of orcs chasing you and your companions down a hallway? Maybe tearing the decrepit tapestries from the walls will hamper their pursuit.

None of the above ideas are listed on a character sheet. Although you should use your stats, spells, gear, and talents, don't limit yourself only to those.

## Onward!
The next sections detail the core rules of Shadowdark RPG. Armed with your dice and your wits, you're ready to learn the legendary art of crawling. Stride boldly into the darkness!
