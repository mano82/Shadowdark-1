The world is still perilous for fortune-seekers outside the gloomy Shadowdark. When traveling overland, these rules add to the crawling rules.

## Turns And Time
The game moves in initiative order as normal while traveling overland, and groups often travel in chunks that comprise several hours. Use the [[Time#Time Passes]] rules (pg. 82) as needed.

Check for **random encounters** using the following cadence during overland travel:
- **Unsafe.** Check every 3 hours.
- **Risky.** Check every 2 hours.
- **Deadly.** Check every hour.

### Light
If needed, determine how much time remains on the current light source by rolling 1d6 x 10 minutes. There is rarely total darkness outside, even at night.

## Travel Per Day
PCs can travel for up to 8 hours a day. They must pass increasing CON checks to push further. Hexes are 6-miles across.

## Navigation
PCs in unfamiliar territory must have their navigator make an INT check upon exiting a hex. On a failure, the group moves into a random, adjacent hex.

## Food And Water
PCs can go three days without consuming a ration. They take 1 CON damage each day after that (death at 0). A PC can forage for 1 ration per day with an INT check.
