## Hiding And Sneaking

Creatures who are hiding or sneaking must succeed on Dexterity checks to go undetected by other creatures within eyesight or earshot.

The GM determines the frequency and difficulty of the check based on the environment.

The GM might secretly roll the check for a character if knowledge of the outcome impacts the situation.

### Hiding Limitations.
Creatures can't hide while other creatures are able to see them, even at a casual glance.

It might also be impossible to hide if there's nowhere for a creature to stay out of sight.

## Detecting
Detecting a hiding or sneaking creature requires the searcher to actively look or listen.

Looking in the right place automatically reveals a hidden creature. Otherwise, the searcher must succeed on a Wisdom check to perceive a sneaking or hiding creature.

## Surprise
A creature who begins its turn undetected has the advantage of surprise. If combat hasn't started yet, those with surprise take one turn before the combat initiative roll (see Combat Initiative! on pg. 88).

A creature has advantage on attack rolls against surprised targets.

Attacking from hiding gives away the attacker's position afterwards unless the GM determines otherwise.
