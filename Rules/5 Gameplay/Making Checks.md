## When To Roll?

Usually, you succeed at what you're trained to do without needing to roll a check.

For example, a wizard is always able to read magical runes, and a thief always finds a trap if searching in the right area.

If you take the time to scan the sky for threats or examine a stretch of wall for a secret door, you simply succeed.

**Social encounters** usually rely on what you say rather than Charisma checks. Narrating a moving speech or using secret information you gathered to influence an NPC does not require a check to succeed.

The GM asks for a check when the following is true:
- The action has a **negative consequence** for failure
- The action requires **skill**
- There is **time pressure**

## Difficulty Class
The four standard DCs represent how difficult an action is.

### Easy, DC 9. 
Leaping a narrow chasm, sneaking up on an inattentive guard.

### Normal, DC 12. 
Kicking open a stuck door, picking a poor lock.

### Hard, DC 15. 
Swimming against a strong current, giving first aid to stop a character from dying.

### Extreme, DC 18. 
Climbing a slippery cliff one-handed, restraining a frenzied lion.

## Contested Checks
If multiple creatures are working against each other on a conflicting task, a contested check decides who succeeds.

To make a contested check, each participant rolls one relevant stat check at the same time, even if it's not their turn. The highest result wins (reroll ties).
