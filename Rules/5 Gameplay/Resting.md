## Resting
Injured characters can rest to recover from their wounds. To rest, a character must consume a ration and sleep for 8 hours.

Sleep can be broken up for light and routine tasks, such as taking a turn on watch.

### Interruption.
Each stressful interruption of rest (including combat) requires an affected character to make a DC 12 Constitution check.

On a failure, the character consumes a ration but gains no benefit from resting.

### Success.
A character who successfully rests regains all lost hit points and recovers any stat damage (all stat damage is temporary unless described otherwise).

Additionally, some talents, spells, or items regain their ability to be used after a successful rest.

## Danger Level
Characters can rest anywhere, but doing so inside a dungeon or perilous environment carries a high chance of failure due to the risk of a random encounter.

While the characters are resting in a dangerous environment, the Game Master checks for random encounters using the overland travel cadence:
- **Unsafe.** Check every 3 hours.
- **Risky.** Check every 2 hours.
- **Deadly.** Check every hour.

## Campfire
In many cases, adventurers need a light source while resting. Characters can combine three torches into a campfire that can't be moved once lit.

A campfire lasts up to 8 hours while at least one character remains near to it, and it casts light out to a near distance.
