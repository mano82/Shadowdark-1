# [[Scrying]]

You look into a crystal ball or reflecting pool, calling up images of a distant place. 

For the spell's duration, you can see and hear a creature or location you choose that is on the same plane. 

This spell is DC 18 to cast if you try to scry on a creature or location that is unfamiliar to you. 

Each round, creatures you view may make a Wisdom check vs. your last spellcasting check. On a success, they become aware of your magical observation.
