If this is your first time playing **Shadowdark RPG** , it’s helpful to start with a premade character. The free digital Shadowdark RPG Quickstart Set has a few!

## Characters
You decide your character’s actions and tell them to the referee, or Game Master ( GM ).

The GM determines if your actions are successful and describes the results.

This back-and-forth between you, the GM, and your adventuring companions grows and shapes the game world.

Always ask yourself: If you were really your character, what would you do right now?

## Describe An Action
On your turn , describe an action you want to do. For example, you could say you’re going to shoot your bow at a troll.

The GM might ask you to do a check (see Checks) to determine whether your action succeeds.

## Movement
During your turn, you can move up to near (roughly 30 feet). You can break this movement up in any way. If you don’t take an action, you can move near again.

## Rounds
Each person takes a turn, starting with the GM and going clockwise. The GM controls the monsters and environment and narrates how everyone’s actions change the game world.

Once everyone has taken a turn, that completes one round. Then, a new round begins.

## The Dice
You'll need a:
#### four-sided ( **d4** )
#### six-sided ( **d6** )
#### eight-sided ( **d8** )
#### ten-sided ( **d10** )
#### twelve-sided ( **d12** )
#### twenty-sided ( **d20** )

### **Multiples.**
3d6 = three six-sided dice. Roll them together and add them.

### **Advantage.** 
Roll two times and use the better result.

### **Disadvantage.** 
Roll two times and use the worse result.

## **STATS**
Stats are your characteristics. Each stat goes from 3-18 and has a bonus or penalty (called a modifier , or MOD) from -4 to +4.

### **Strength.** 
Physical power.

### **Dexterity.**
Agility, reflexes.

### **Constitution.**
Endurance, resistance to injury.

### **Intelligence.**
Logical ability.

### **Wisdom.**
Instinct, willpower.

### **Charisma.**
Appeal, presence.

## CHECKS
When attempting a risky action, roll a d20 and add a modifier. That’s called making a check.

The GM chooses the check's linked stat and a number called a difficulty class ( DC ). If the total of your d20 roll + stat modifier equals or beats the DC, your action succeeds.

For example, the GM might say leaping over a narrow chasm requires a DC 9 Strength check.

## HIT POINTS
Injuries cause you to take damage and lose hit points ( HP ). Typical weapons deal 1d damage to your HP. You regain lost HP after a night of rest.

Characters at zero HP die in 1d4 + Constitution modifier (minimum 1) rounds. Dead characters are retired from play!

## WHAT’S NEXT?
You could play a whole game with just the basics. But once you're ready for more, the next chapters expand upon them.
