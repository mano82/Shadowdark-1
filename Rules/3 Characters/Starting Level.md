## 0-Level Characters
Some games begin with 0-level characters — weak peasants who have not yet attained the skill required to be adventurers.

0-level characters are fragile. GMs should see The Gauntlet on pg. 116 for more insight.

Because 0-level characters have **beginner's luck**, they can wield all gear until 1st level.

0-level characters start with:
- [[Stats]], pg. 15
- Choice of Ancestry, pg. 16
- Hit points equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1)
- [[Background]], pg. 26
- Choice of alignment, pg. 27
- [[Starting Gear, AC]], pg. 33

0-level characters reach **1st level** after surviving their first adventure (see pg. 39).

## 1st-Level Characters
Some games begin with 1st-level characters — fledgling heroes who are ready to go on dangerous adventures.

These characters are tougher than their 0-level counterparts and have more defined roles in their adventuring teams.

1st-level characters start with:
- [[Stats]], pg. 15
- Choice of ancestry, pg. 16
- Choice of class, pg. 18-
- One class talent roll
- Hit points equal to one roll of their class's hit points die + their Constitution modifier (minimum 1); these replace the hit points the character had at level 0
- [[Background]], pg. 26
- Choice of alignment, pg. 27
- [[Compendium/Class/Titles]], pg. 30
- [[Starting Gear, AC]], pg. 33
