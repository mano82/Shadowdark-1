## Experience Points

XP represents your learning, influence, and increasing skill.

XP awards are based on the quality of the treasure and boons you gain during a session. GMs should see Awarding XP on pg. 117 for guidance.

The GM can award XP right away or at the end of each session.

## Leveling Up

To gain a level, you need to earn your **current level x 10 XP**.

Once you reach a new level, your total XP resets back to zero.

You get any new title, spells, and talent improvements listed for your level. Your maximum HP increases, and you might also gain a talent roll.
