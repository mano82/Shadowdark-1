Patrons are eldritch beings of immense power who gift magical ability and boons to mortals who petition their favor.

Patrons are not seeking worship from petitioners. Instead, they want something in exchange for the power they grant.

The Willowman might demand to drink of the petitioner's nightmares on the dark of the moon. Mugdulblub might require the boiling of tooth and bone. What these eldritch demands truly mean reveals itself over time.
