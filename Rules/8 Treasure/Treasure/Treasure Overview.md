## Treasure
Treasure is the driving force behind character advancement. Claiming treasure grants the characters XP and gives them valuable resources.

#### Wandering Monsters
have only a 50% chance of carrying treasure. They are poor sources of XP and valuables!

## Fleeting
Carousing (pg. 92) allows PCs to gain XP fast, but they'll soon need to go adventuring again to replenish their empty pockets. Wealth is a fleeting prize.

## Treasure Tables
You can use treasure tables ([[Treasure 0-3]][[Treasure 4-6]][[Treasure 7-9]][[Treasure 10+]]) to randomly determine what loot a monster is carrying.

The treasure table the monster uses corresponds to its level. For example, a level 2 monster uses the Treasure 0-3 table.

## Unguarded
The GM can randomly generate unguarded treasure by rolling on the treasure table that matches the discovering character's level.

For example, a 6th-level wizard finds a treasure chest. The wizard rolls on the Treasure 4-6 table to determine what's inside.

## Dealing With Loot
Treasure typically occupies one gear slot (coins occupy one slot per 100), but the GM might determine otherwise.

Characters can sell most treasure based on its material value, but they may need to find a curio collector to offload strange or obscure items.

## Magic Item Values
Magic items can rarely be bought or sold. In such a case, weak magic items are worth 1d6 x 100 gp. Powerful ones, if not priceless, are worth 2d6 x 100 gp.
