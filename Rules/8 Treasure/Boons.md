Boons are non-monetary sources of value or benefit.

### Oaths.
A favor owed by a unicorn, a title granted by a baron, or the promise of safe harbor by a dryad you helped.

### Secrets.
The identity of a murderer, the corrupt bishop's incriminating letters, or the *True Name* of a demon.

### Blessings.
An enchantment from a magical fountain or a dryad's gift of the ability to speak to birds. Blessings can be temporary or permanent.

## XP Value
A boon's XP value is based on its utility. For example, a favor promised by a member of the Thieves' Guild might be normal treasure, but a god's blessing would be legendary treasure.
