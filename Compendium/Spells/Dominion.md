Mighty beings come to your aid. 

The beings must have a combined total of 16 levels or less. Chaotic PCs summon demons/devils, and lawful or neutral PCs summon angels. 

The beings act of free will to aid you on your turn. After 10 rounds, they return to their realms. 

You cannot cast this spell again until you complete penance
