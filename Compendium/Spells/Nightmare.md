You visit the dreams of one sleeping creature, sending it heart-stopping nightmares. 

You can target a creature whose level is less than or equal to half your level rounded down (minimum 1). The target must be sleeping, and you must have seen it before in person. If you successfully focus on this spell for 3 rounds in a row, the creature dies of fright.
