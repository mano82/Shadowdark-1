A creature you touch has a random stat reduced to 3 (-4) for one week. 

Roll a d6 to determine which stat: 

| dice:1d6 | Stat         |
| -------- | ------------ |
| 1        | Strength     |
| 2        | Dexterity    |
| 3        | Constitution |
| 4        | Intelligence |
| 5        | Wisdom       |
| 6        | Charisma     |
^enfeebleroll

If you fail the spellcasting check, you have a random stat reduced to 3 for a week instead.

Example roll: `dice: [[Enfeeble#^enfeebleroll]]`
