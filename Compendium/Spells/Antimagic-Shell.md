An invisible, near-sized cube of  null-magic appears centered on  you.  

Within the cube, no spells can  be cast. Magic items and spells  have no effect in the zone, and  no magic can enter.  

The cube moves with you. Spells  such as dispel magic have no  effect on it.  

Another antimagic shell does  not affect this one.
