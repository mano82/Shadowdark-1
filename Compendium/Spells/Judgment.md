You instantly banish a creature you touch, sending it and all possessions it carries to face the judgment of your god. 

You can banish an intelligent creature of LV 10 or less. 

When the creature returns in 5 rounds, it has been healed to full hit points if its deeds pleased your god. It has been reduced to 1 hit point if its deeds angered your god. If your god can't judge its actions, it is unchanged.
