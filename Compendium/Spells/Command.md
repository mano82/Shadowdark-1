You issue a verbal command to  one creature in range who can  understand you. The command  must be one word, such as  “kneel.” The target obeys the  command for as long as you  focus.  

If your command is ever directly  harmful to the creature, it may  make a Charisma check vs. your  last spellcasting check. On a  success, the spell ends.
