You transform yourself and any gear you carry into another natural creature you've seen of level 10 or less. You assume the creature's physical stats and features, but you retain your non-physical stats and features (including INT, WIS, and CHA). 

If you go to 0 HP while under the effects of this spell, you revert to your true form at 1 HP.
