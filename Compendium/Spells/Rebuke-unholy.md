You rebuke creatures who oppose your alignment, forcing them to flee. You must present a holy symbol to cast this spell. 

If you are lawful or neutral, this spell affects demons, devils, and outsiders. If you are chaotic, this spell affects angels and natural creatures of the wild. 

Affected creatures within near of you must make a CHA check vs. your spellcasting check. If a creature fails by 10+ points and is equal to or less than your level, it is destroyed. Otherwise, on a fail, it flees from you for 5 rounds.
