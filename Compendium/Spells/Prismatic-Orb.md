You send a strobing orb of energy streaking toward a target within range. 

Choose an energy type from fire, cold, or electricity. The orb deals `dice: 3d8` damage and delivers a concussive blast of the chosen energy type. 

If the energy type is anathema to the target's existence (for example, cold energy against a fire elemental), the orb deals double damage to it instead.
