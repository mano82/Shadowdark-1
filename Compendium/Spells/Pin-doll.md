You pin a piece of hair or flesh taken from one creature to a small, burlap doll the spell conjures.

On your turn while focusing on this spell, you can push a pin into the doll. Each time you do this, the creature who the hair or flesh belonged to takes `dice: 2d6` 2d6 damage. After this spell ends, the piece of hair or flesh burns to ash.
