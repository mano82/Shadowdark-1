# [[Illusion]]

You create a convincing visible and audible illusion that fills up to a near-sized cube in range.

The illusion cannot cause harm, but creatures who believe the illusion is real react to it as though it were. 

A creature who inspects the illusion from afar must pass a Wisdom check vs. your last [[spellcasting]] check to perceive the false nature of the illusion. 

Touching the illusion also reveals its false nature.
