Angels are the divine host of lawful and neutral gods. 
They appear as winged, beautiful humanoids who radiate light and are suffused with their gods' energies and symbols.

[[Seraphim]] are the lowest sphere of angel and often walk among mortals. [[Domini]] are their lords, and the powerful [[Principi]] govern over the domini. Above all stand the mighty archangels.
