If your familiar dies, you can restore it to life by permanently sacrificing 1d4 hit points.

### Spellcasting. 
You can cast wizard spells you know.

You know three tier 1 spells of your choice from the [[Witch Spell List]].

Each time you gain a level, you choose new wizard spells to learn according to the Witch Spells Known table below.

You use your Charisma stat to cast witch spells. The DC is 10 + the spell's tier.

If you fail a [[Casting Spells#Spellcasting|spellcasting]] check, you can't cast that spell again until you complete a rest.

If you roll a natural 1 on a spellcasting check, you must also roll on the corresponding [[Diabolical Mishaps]] table for the spell's tier.
