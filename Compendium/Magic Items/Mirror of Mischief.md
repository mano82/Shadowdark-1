#### *A full-length mirror polished to a gleaming shine. Grinning, silver demons grasp the mirror, their claws forming its frame.*

>[!fail] Curse
>- The first time a humanoid creature looks into this mirror, the mirror creates an evil and malicious duplicate of them. 
>- The duplicate can step from the mirror and is an exact copy of the subject (except for magical gear, which looks identical but is mundane in nature).
>- The evil duplicate can live indefinitely outside the mirror. It attempts to sow chaos in the life of the creature it duplicated.
